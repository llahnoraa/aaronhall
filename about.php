    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Aaron Hall</strong>. I'm a user interface designer, front-end developer, creative problem solver and free-thinker living in the <strong>Sunshine State</strong> with <a title="The Hall Happenings" href="http://thehallhappenings.com" target="_blank">my wife</a> and our little girl, Lilla. I enjoy writing code to create stunning, simplistic and <strong>responsive</strong> designs which are both usable and effective and designing mockups for longer than I can remember. I've had the fortune of working with companies like MTV, Lucasfilm, CircleCi, Gigboard, CrankApps as well as a number of talented independent developers and designers.</p>
    <h4>On a personal note</h4>
    <p>I grew up in a small town Lenoir City outside of Knoxville in the Volunteer State and went to school at <a title="Full Sail University" href="http://fullsail.edu" target="_blank">Full Sail University</a> to study web design &amp; development.</p>
    <p>When not sitting in front of computer, I enjoy camping trips with my family, fishing in the Florida Keys, hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains, riding my mountain bike, watching movies and TV shows, and working on side projects. And eating. I love eating. I fancy myself an amateur photographer (which mostly means that I bought a DSLR) with my Canon Rebel T3i, trying my best to learn the craft.</p>

    <h4>About this site</h4>
    <p>Each version of aaron.im is driven by the desire to learn a new technique, for example this version features a responsive layout using <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io" target="_blank">neat.bourbon.io</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> (an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, etc.) using <a href="http://bourbon.io/" target="_blank">bourbon.io</a> and retina-ready for devices with retina displays. This site was designed for all browsers except IE (sorry but you should check it out on IE), built using the <a href="http://bourbon.io/" target="_blank">Bourbon</a>, <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io" target="_blank">Neat</a>, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>, <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">Codekit</a>, and <del>Coda</del> <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text 3</a> running on <a href="http://php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>. All pixels are used by <a href="http://wacom.com/intuos/" target="_blank">Wacom Intuos</a> and I've been mouse-free as long as I can remember.</p>
    <p>My entire site has a <strong>responsive design</strong>. Don't be afraid to test it on your mobile/tablet!</p>
